Virtual Sensor
--------------
USES:
 - Anomaly detection as a digital twin
 	- Given hourly rainfall input, can detect anomalous readings
 	  which can happen either because the sensor malfunctioned or
 	  the environment changed
 	- If multiple sensors capture similar trend, the environment
 	  changed. If not, it is a sensor malfunction
 	  

 - Data interpolation
 	- During sensor outage, the virtual data can reliably predict
 	  peak stream height which can be used for informed interpolation
 	
 	- Using the rainfall accumulation strategy below(offset for the time
 	  of interest), we can predict stream height in between sensor readings,
 	  even when the sensor is working nominaly.
 	  
METHOD:
1. Accumulate hourly rainfall
	- Non-uniform time intervals are handled by creating minute level data which is accumulated in uniform hourly bins
2. Water level data
	- Hourly maximum is chosen
3. Combined rainfall and waterlevel time series is created
	- For each arbitrarily long rainfall event, data from timestamps 7 hours before and after is also preserved
	- For each preserved timestamp, past rainfall in a 12hr window is calculated and stored
4. An LSTM NN is trained using just rainfall as input to predict the current stream height
	- 2 dim input feature vector - > [hourly rainfall;12 hr accumulation]
	- Sequence length of 7 hours
