NHC 7
------
1. Rejected rainfall events with less than 0.2mm/15mins.
2. At first, trained on 7 hours of past data only before adding the past 12hr data dimension.
3. Therefore, each rain event starts with no peak for a few datapoints, gets a peak, returns to prepeak/elevated levels for the remaining 7hr window.

4. When we do least squares regression with Aw + intercept  = -b, since A is positve definite, w is mostly positive and intercept is the
water level before the rain event, definitely negative.
5. Least squares gets dominated by before the rain data points becuase there is too many of them, the peaks are lesser in number 
and are of varying heights.
6. We need a way to weight the outliers more than the regulars
    a. weighted least squares where ri = -log(binned frequency/max frequency)
    b. detect outliers using hampel filter -> flag outliers in a sliding window
        and do least squares on the outliers
On NHC7, the hampel approach looks better.

7. Turns out that Non Negative Least Squares gives us all positive weights which is appropriate given A is positive definite.
8. Lasso sends the smaller weights to zero resulting in a more pleasing weight distribution.
9. 12hr data results in even better peak description capability, although the weights are less intuitive.
