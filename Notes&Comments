Notes & Comments
----------------

1. Weather station #2 and #3 have mostly consistent 5-6 minute data.
	- Deleted some duplicate timestamps from #3(July)
	- Deleted some sparse data from #2 7-28 to 8-03
	- Occasional missed timestamps
	
2. Rainfall data processing
	- Created 1m weather reading by averaging each entry over time delta
	- Summed 1m averages to create any frequency greater than 6 minutes!
	
3. Runoff data processing
	- NHC sensors have 11-12 minute OK/noisy data
	- Interpolation between entries
	- NHC_7 has 5-6 minute high quality data
		- 4 hour time to concentration
		- dynamics at any time stamp greater than 6 minutes!
	- Using min() we can capture significant dynamics at HOURLY interval!
		- Causes a temporal offset in readings but happens to both rainfall
		and runoff, so not a problem.
		- We do lose out on some potentially good training data, since
		small rain events are not represented(because they accumulate.)
	- Still need data for NHC1787

4. Adding a second feature vector for cumulative rainfall in the past 24hrs
	- Can no longer use the trailing hourly zeros after the previous rainfall
		Need a way to fill (0,0) for the past entries for each isolated rain event
	- 
5. The data even before the intrduction of the 24 hr vector is not perfect. e.g.
	can_delete is meant to just use precip and identify (7hr) windows of no rain.
	If it can't see past data either due to start of the file or data not available
	due to WS shut down, it leaves the row blank. What is deleted are rows that are
	it is 100% sure are uninteresting or 0.
	However, if both the WS and gauge data is not available, and there hasn't been any rain, it will admit the first point when the gage starts working


6. We don't need to worry about guage data - N/A gage data will be taken out by the
	dropna().
	can_delete should not have to consider all previous points
	
12/30/23 - Moving on to 15 minute data
--------------------------------------
1. Create a file with timed 15 minute rainfall and max river height in the last 15 minutes AND accumulated rainfall in past 12 hours
2. Train with a 7h*4 length sequence. The second element is rainfall in the past 12 hours
3. Max river height offsets the statistics to the right
